# AdventofCode2025
For working throught he advent of Code challenges in 2025

Day 1 part 1 complete, had an embarassing issue with this due to being rusty and misusing C/P, so both if's in my code were checking for R in th e movement, not R or L
DaY 1 PART 2 complete, had to figure out what edge cases were interfering with my count, then how to handle them
Also added a file selector for easier use and testing
